# Movie-Recommender-System
I have used datasets from TMDB website, here is the link to download it:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

For this project I have also used api key to fetch data(in my case this is posters of movies to show) from TMDB, as this api key is not confidential it is already written in my code itself
